As our immediate and only senior, you have consistently been more than just a senior â€“ you have been a guiding sibling, leading us through uncharted territories.\nThis event is a sincere attempt on our part to repay, in some measure, the camaraderie and support you've generously offered. Let us make some more memories to recall, more stories to tell and some more moments to cherish as we spend the day together. \nWe cordially invite you to join us for this heartwarming occasion, filled with nostalgia, reflections, and expressions of gratitude. Your presence would undoubtedly enhance the significance of this memorable evening.\nWe look forward to sharing this special moment with you.\n\nBest Regards\nGaurav Poudel\nBCH077 "
